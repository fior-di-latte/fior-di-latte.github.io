The *Steiner tree problem* is certainly one of the most popular examples of NP-complete
problems. It’s one of Karp’s famous 21 NP-complete problems which have been proposed in 1972. Named after Swiss mathematician *Jakob Steiner (1796-1863)* whose work
overwhelmingly dealt with geometric problems, the Steiner tree problem has found many
applications in our modern world - for example in logistics, computer chip design, IT and
others.

**This seminar paper** gives a brief overview on the Steiner tree problem in general before
focusing on the current state-of-the-art approximation algorithm.
