My app 'Otter Day' just made it onto the „The One“ billboard in Times Square, NYC!
The reason behind this: It won the [Best Vibes award](https://devpost.com/software/otter-day-weekday-guesser) at RevenueCat's Shipaton for creative AI usage.
The win email took me by surprise, and before I knew it, I was on a plane to New York to attend the RAGA (RevenueCat App Growth Annual) and pick up the trophy. The conference and App Week were incredible—well-organized, high-profile, and full of interesting people and conversations.
Heartfelt thanks to the amazing team at RevenueCat (+ sponsors) for hosting the Shipaton, which keeps bringing indie developers together. Also, big thanks to my employer KMH GmbH for supporting my 'side hustle endeavors' —and for letting me hop on that last-minute flight to NYC. 

Also, it was great to see the city for the first time in real life. Unsurprisingly to me, it felt oddly familiar because of all the movies and TV shows I had seen that are based in the city. Besides visiting the tourist spots (Brooklyn Bridge, One World Trade Center, Museum of Modern Art, SOHO, Wall Street, Central Park, Broadway) I had on my list,  it was very delightful to just get lost for a few blocks just to find myself at another famous place (Oh, hi, Plaza Hotel and Trump Tower).

# About the app:

It’s a game that teaches you to figure out the day of the week for any date in under five seconds in your head. July 4, 1776? Thursday. Your 70th birthday? Friday. Intentionally nerdy, yet super accessible It is a fun math crosswords game that is story-driven, targeting the Sudoku / 2048 / numberphile audience.  

Development was vastly supported by AI tools like Perplexity (images, memonic sentences, dialogs), KlingAI (animations/videos), and Elevenlabs (voiceovers). Vibecoding was not part of the story.

Needless to say, I have many things planned for Otter Day in terms of product and distribution. Exciting months ahead!
