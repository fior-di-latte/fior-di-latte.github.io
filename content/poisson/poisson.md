My Master thesis focused on exploring random connection models, which are versatile mathematical tools employed across different fields, including the study of social networks. It aims to understand and describe a new parametrization of a special class of those models ("*scale-free percolation models in the continuum*")  by examining their properties related to clustering and graph distances.
